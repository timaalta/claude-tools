# Claude Code Tips for Beginners

Essential tips and best practices for getting started with Claude Code effectively.

## üöÄ Getting Started Right

### First Steps
1. **Install globally**: `npm install -g @anthropic/claude-code`
2. **Start interactive session** in your project directory
3. **Begin with exploration** - ask Claude to understand your project first
4. **Progress gradually** from simple to complex tasks

### Let Claude Explore First
Before making changes, have Claude analyze your codebase:
- "Analyze the database schema"
- "Understand the project structure" 
- "Explore the current implementation"
- "What technologies does this project use?"

## üí° Pro Tips

### Be Specific with Requests
‚ùå **Vague**: "fix the bug"  
‚úÖ **Specific**: "fix the login bug where users see a blank screen after entering wrong credentials"

‚ùå **Vague**: "improve the code"  
‚úÖ **Specific**: "optimize the database query in getUserProfiles() to reduce response time"

### Use Step-by-Step Instructions
Break complex tasks into manageable steps:

**Example workflow:**
1. Create a database table for user profiles
2. Create an API endpoint for profile management  
3. Build a webpage for user information editing
4. Add validation and error handling
5. Write tests for the new functionality

### Conversational Approach
- Treat Claude like a helpful colleague
- Describe what you want to achieve, not just how
- Be clear and direct in your instructions
- Ask follow-up questions for clarification

## ‚å®Ô∏è Productivity Shortcuts

- **Tab**: Command completion
- **‚Üë Arrow**: Access command history
- **/** : See available slash commands
- **Ctrl+C**: Cancel current operation

## üéØ Best Practices

### Communication Style
- Use natural language for all tasks
- Explain the context and goals
- Ask for explanations when needed
- Review all proposed changes before approval

### Task Management
- Start with understanding project structure
- Ask about main entry points and technologies
- Use Claude for debugging, refactoring, and code changes
- Always test changes after implementation

### Common Workflows
1. **Code Analysis**: "What does this function do?"
2. **Bug Fixing**: "Debug why the login form isn't working"
3. **Feature Addition**: "Add user authentication to this app"
4. **Refactoring**: "Improve the structure of this component"
5. **Documentation**: "Add comments explaining this algorithm"

## üîß Advanced Tips

### Project Understanding
- Ask Claude to identify the tech stack
- Have Claude explain the project architecture
- Request guidance on coding conventions used
- Get recommendations for project improvements

### Efficient Collaboration
- Provide context about your role and goals
- Mention any constraints or requirements
- Ask for multiple solution options
- Request explanations for complex changes
